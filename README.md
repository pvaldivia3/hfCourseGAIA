This code is for the final project of the HuggingFace Agents course.  Some of the tool code was found through searching documentation for langchain/langgraph tools, while other portions of the tool code were found in other publicly posted solutions to the challenge.  

In this assignment, we were asked to write an agent that answered questions from the level-1 GAIA question bank.  The code in this repository answered up to six questions correctly in one run, though not consistently (in fact, I believe that seven distinct questions have been answered correctly, though inconsistently).

The code also demonstrates a basic usage of tools using LangGraph.  The SmolAgents framework is also used, though only for the CodeAgent tool.
